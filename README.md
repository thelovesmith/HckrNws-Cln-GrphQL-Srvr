#What is GraphQl?
+GraphQL is a new API standard that provides a more efficient and powerful alternative to REST
+It enables declarative data fetching. The client can specify the data it wants to fetch
+Instead of multiple endpoints, the GraphQL API exposes a single endpoint and sends back precisely the data being requested 

#More effiecint than REST 
+With increased mobile usage there was a need for a more efficient method for loading data
+There are now a variety of front end frameworks and platforms, so there was a need for an API that can fulfill the requirements for all. GraphQL makes this easier. One fetch, specific data.
+Continuous deployment and fast development speed

#lil History 
+Used by Facebook since 2012 
+Was publicly discussed in 2015 

#Better Than REST 
+No more over- or under-fetching data. You get the exact data you ask for!! Much more efficient 
+Insightful analytics in the backend. Since dtat being fetched is sepcific, you cna get analytics on what data is being requested and what data doesn't get anymore love from the clients 
+Schema and Type-based system makes it easier for front end and back end development to work seperately because they have a definite structure for the data.
